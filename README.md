Hi! My name is __Ilia Starchevus__. I'm doing my programming projects and posting some here.

Recently I just learned basics about programming on Python and now going forward for doing more complicated, but interesting things. I'm fond of in coding Python projects step by step to learn about web-development. Making some goals and reaching them. As a main goal I want to be hired as a backend-developer in future.

Also I'm practicing English by watching YouTube videos. I would love to communicate with you if you were a native speaker.

To reach me you can write me in [Telegram](https://t.me/IliaStarchevus).
